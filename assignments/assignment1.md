## 🧠💭 10 Domains / 3 Problems For 3 Domains

1. Exploring new places/media: I like to try new food, recipes, books, movies, and music whenever I can.

   - **Finding restaurants/places to eat and places to visit**: Over the summer I was in Seattle for an internship but was constantly at a loss of what to do/where to go. I would use google maps and zoom in/out with filters on restaurants or just google places I should go, but I always found it difficult to commit to exploring these random places without it being grounded by a credible source (since there are too many food rating apps) or by being a recommendation by someone I know. I relied a lot on recommendations from my friends who got recommendations (also by word of mouth), and really only went anywhere if someone at work told me about an event. I think there's two issues here that could be solved: having some sort of like master database for best rated places to go in an area (instead of relying on just aimlessly scrolling), and also being able to find someone to go with you, since I personally found it difficult to commit to a plan to go out without someone else participating in it with me.
   - **Media consumption tracker**: There are so many books, movies, and anime that I've read/watched but I can't remember them all-- sometimes I have to google bits of a plot or one really specific vivid scene that I remember to match it to the book/movie, and hope that someone on Reddit has had the exact same question and that it has been answered. I've started lists of animes that I've watched that I've committed to for a few years now, but I have lists of books I've read on a different platform and I would like all of these things to be in a central location for easy reference (and it would be fun to see what others are reading/watching as well)! The issue is making the task of having to log all these things not feel like a chore and also make sure that the user doesn't forget to log it.
   - **Watching movies/listening to music or podcasts together**: Having to share an earbud in-person or screenshare in order to listen to something together is not ideal. If there was an app to join someone while they were watching a movie or listening to music, it would also make it easy to spend quality time with friends/family long-distance.

2. Daily Routines: chores and routines that I do a daily basis include sleeping, eating/buying groceries, and journaling.
   - **Journaling/goal setting/habit tracking**: I would find these things to be much more fulfilling if I could do them with others. Oftentimes I forget or miss a week due to laziness, which could be solved by peer pressure (in a nice way). If everyone could do these things together in a group and see each other's stats, it would be easy to commit to working on goals together like going to the gym. I would also like to keep a diary of each day since it's fun to look back on very specific memories years into the future, but it's hard to stick to it without someone else that is waiting for an update from you to hear about your day.
   - **(Over)sleeping**: It can be too easy to sleep through an alarm that you've grown accustomed to, and I've already rotated through all the possible alarm sounds on my iPhone. I need other people to set my alarm so that I can be surprised enough by their selection to wake up in the morning.
   - **Keeping track of what groceries I need to get**: I often save recipes and random things I want to bake/cook in collections while I'm scrolling on Instagram, but I never commit to making them because of the barrier of having to go through these recipes and plan when I'm going to make them, and prepping the supplies/groceries necessary to make them. I also don't want my current groceries to go bad if I buy more food, which makes it even harder to experiment with new recipes. It would be helpful to be able to see what recipes I want to make, my meal plan for using up current groceries, and being able to automatically see what new things I need to buy/restock.
3. Social interaction (outside of school): I interact with people through shopping, especially on dormspam sales (which I do a lot of, typically for clothes), texting and staying updated on the things happening in my friends' lives back home, and playing multiplayer online games.
   - **Shopping**: With social anxiety, it can be difficult to buy/sell things on a public online platform (like dormspam), especially since people tend to get away with being rude/aggressive online rather than in-person. Having something like Etsy but just for a localized community can make it easier for people to make anonymous bids on an item. It would make all sales be on one platform, insteaad of being barraged with sale emails at the beginning and end of every semester.
   - **Maintaining social relationships**: After you text someone, their chat is at the top of your DMs. But if you text many other people, those DMs can quickly become lost, and if that person is not someone you see on an active basis and their chat is not at the forefront of a messaging app, it can be easy to lose touch with them. I would like some form of reminders (that I wouldn't ignore) to text my high school friends more regularly, rather than once in a blue moon when something reminds me of them, or when I return home once a year. Social connection can also feel burdensome or overwhelming when balancing other social commitments and school.
   - **Doing multiplayer crossword puzzles**: There was a phase of my life where I had an unhealthy obsession with multiplayer crosswords (where multiple people can fill things in at the same time), that ultimately died out due to frustration with my lack of ability to comprehend many of the references that were made in the crosswords, especially with references to sports and movies. I always craved crosswords that had to do with really niche computer science or biology topics, or references that had to do with my specific interests, but couldn't find any-- with LLMs they could be easily generated.
4. Playing sports: I enjoy playing badminton and tennis
5. Health/fitness: I try to go to the gym and run regularly
6. Gardening/keeping houseplants alive: I have lots of houseplants back home and enjoy decorating spaces with plants as part of an overall hobby of interior design
7. Art: I enjoy crocheting and painting but often only do these things for people's birthdays to give as gifts
8. Playing video games: playing mobile games, RPG games, gacha games, and browsing games on Steam
9. Photography: experimenting with different types of lenses, photographing people/places for use in collages and videos
10. Learning languages: languages that I've studied (most are not in depth) include Chinese, Spanish, Latin, Japanese, and Russian

## 💡 3 Selected Problems

### Problem 1: Maintaining social relationships

**Why I selected this problem**: I chose this since it feels like an important problem to solve (and one that I actively deal with), since having a support network and social relationships is arguably one of the most important things to carry with you in life and contributes to mental and even physical wellbeing. As a college student, it's too easy to be too absorbed into your work and ignore maintaining social relationships as a result, and this would help fight that.

**Stakeholders**

- Close Friend (someone you used to chat with often but rarely reach out to now)
  Impact: They may feel neglected or forgotten when contact fades, even unintentionally. The app could help you maintain consistent contact, fostering emotional bonds and mutual well-being.

- User (the person struggling to remember reaching out to friends)
  Impact: The user may feel guilty or regretful about drifting connections, and may experience loneliness or decreased satisfaction. The app supports you by prompting timely reminders and reducing cognitive load.

- Social Circle (indirect users that are other friends in your social circle that are connected with both of the people above)
  Impact: Maintained individual relationships help preserve the broader social network (group cohesion, shared memories, mutual gatherings). When connections falter, the ripple effect can diminish group interactions and memories.

## Evidence

- Prioritizing social interactions can improve lifespan, health, and well-being as much as smoking. [Link](https://longevity.stanford.edu/lifestyle/2023/12/18/how-social-connection-supports-longevity/#:~:text=The%20researchers%20estimate%20that%20having,longevity%20by%20roughly%2050%20percent.)
- Loneliness increases risk of premature death by 26% and strong social ties improve survival by 50% [Link](https://gazette.blogs.rice.edu/2021/02/17/the-importance-of-friendships-for-mental-health)
- The percentage of people reporting 10+ friends declined from 33% (1990) to 13% (2021), highlighting a growing disconnection trend that this could help solve. [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendship_recession)
- The CDC states that social connectedness helps reduce risks of chronic diseases like heart disease, stroke, dementia, depression, and anxiety. [Link](https://www.cdc.gov/social-connectedness/about/index.html)
- Contact reminder apps exist that raise notifications, but this may be ignored (would be better to just be integrated into a messaging platform) [Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?hl=en_US&id=me.barta.stayintouch)
- The Revere app allows you to store notes/memories/important dates associated with different people, but wouldn't help to remind you to reach out to them unless you actively scroll through the app [Link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/revere-remember-people/id1260429188)

**3 Features**

1. Smart nudge reminders: Tracks last interaction date for each contact and gently nudges you when too much time has passed (customizable frequency per person). Supports the user by trimming cognitive overload and helps avoid drift with close friends. It implicitly benefits the social circle by preserving communication chains.

2. Personal connection timeline: Visualizes your interaction history with each friend (calls, texts, meetups), highlighting patterns like gradual fades or recent gaps. Offers self-awareness and motivation. The user can observe trends like “haven’t texted in 3 weeks.” It reminds you of past closeness, prompting reconnection with a friend and reinforcing communal bonds.

3. Updates directly sent to messages: Updates made by friends (posts, stories, etc) are directly posted to your chat with them. Helps to prompt conversation and raise likelihood of you seeing a friend's activities.

### Problem 2: Peer Journaling/goal setting/habit tracking

I chose this since I have personal insight into how much more motivating it is to share progress with peers. It also makes for a technically feasible and engaging project (reminders, gamification, small social features) that I would personally use (and convince my friends to use with me).

**Stakeholders**

- User (the individual trying to build a journaling or habit routine)
  Impact: The user gains structure in their routine and motivation from peers to stay consistent with progress through friendly peer-pressure.

- Peer group (other people in the shared challenge/group who encourage consistency)
  Impact: Peers benefit from shared accountability and bond over shared goals, leading to more emotional closeness within the group.

- Potential users (those that are invited to join app by someone, or those that want to use the app but cannot due to having a lack of social connections)
  Impact: Some people would like to keep their individual goals private, and would thus feel unnecessary peer pressure from others to join them. Some people may feel shame for not having a group that they are close enough to for progress sharing.

## Evidence

- A meta-analysis found that peer support significantly improved both self-efficacy (ability to do things) and self-management behaviors for people with type 2 diabetes. This suggests peer involvement helps people stick with changes [Link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33229189/)
- In a study of ~2,200 adolescents, peer support had a strong effect on exercise adherence. This shows peer encouragement helps sustain habits [Link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36832530/)
- This shows that the habit of journaling is beneficial that it has benefits in reducing symptoms in depression, anxiety, PTSD, etc. [Link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35304431/)
- Using a "go with the crowd" mentality causes children to tend to give in to peer pressure, which in this case would help them achieve their goals [Link](https://centerstone.org/our-resources/health-wellness/what-is-peer-pressure-and-who-is-at-risk/)
- The journaling ecosystem on Youtube and other social media has grown, and journalers take inspiration from others in their content, showing that journaling is not only individual, but has social impact that could be shared among a group for mutual inspiration [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19767)
- Many peer support apps exist since they are effective in helping people overcome mental health issues (users reported that they understood the value of socializing in those settings and felt more heard), and the same group support may help individuals achieve their goals and establish healthy routines [Link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39051360/)
- Many mood/activity trackers are mostly made for individual use and have limited social sharing, and this application could introduce that [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylio)

**3 Features**

1. Dependency on user group: goals that are shared among one or more people require everyone within the group to make daily progress towards the goal, or else the streaks for everyone in that group is reset.

2. Connecting with people that you may not know in real life: For potential users that may not have enough connections in real life to use the app with, or those that may prefer anonymity. Matches a user to other users with similar goals (without a chat feature to preserve anonymity and encourage safe use of the app).

3. Private and public settings: Allow goals/journal entries/etc to be set to either private or public to allow potential users to feel comfortable enough to use it, without being pressured to expose everything about their life.

## Problem 3: Media consumption tracker

Many media tracking apps exist: Spotify for podcasts, MyAnimeList for anime, Letterboxd for movies, and Goodreads for books. This is very fragmented and makes it difficult to find others who share your tastes across different media. If all of your logging could be done on a single platform, it would make it less likely that you would forget to track anything. I chose this since I have a personal insight into what would solve the issue: a very minimal interface would likely solve the issue of the burden caused by having to log everything, since my personal issue arises from having to navigate so many different complex interfaces just to log something (which is why I resort to the simple option of writing lists, that I then forget to save or forgot where I kept it). I also really want a "wrapped" feature (like Spotify) but for other types of media like books, anime, and movies, with fun and comprehensive statistics. I think this would be feasible using existing APIs, at least for a few common types of media to begin with.

**Stakeholders**

- User (media consumer who wants to keep a central record of content they've consumed)
  Impact: The user would have reduced frustration and better recall of consumed media.

- Content recommendation platforms (platforms that use media consumption patterns for a user to recommend new content for them)
  Impact: These platforms would benefit from being able to categorize the user based on other media they consume, and would be able to leverage the consolidated user data for improved recommendations.

- Friends/peers (those that the user would share their profile with, and would be interested in the content that the user is consuming)
  Impact: They would benefit from discovering new media via the user's profile, and being able to see the user's profile would spark conversations.

## Evidence

- This discussion on Reddit shows that this is something that many users want for various reasons including some that I listed, but only exists as small personal projects. [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/if7f2i/an_appplatform_to_track_all_media_movies_books)
- This discussion shows people are using "almalgamations" of different platforms that don't "stick", and would prefer an alternative. [Link](https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-do-yall-keep-track-of-media-you-want-to-read-watch-enjoy.1271913)
- There have been complaints about Goodread's UX as well as its function: "Goodreads wants to be about book “discovery” (tell me what to read next,) but I want it to be about book tracking and sharing (help me remember what I have read, and help me tell other people)." This would be the intended functionality of this application. [Link](https://reading-in-bed.com/2023/10/09/goodreads-for-movies-how-about-a-letterboxd-for-books)
- People are actively seeking platforms for other media, that they have liked and used for a different type of media. It would be helpful to combine support for every media type into one app. [Link](https://forums.trakt.tv/t/trakt-for-books-or-other-media/14145)
- People have made a "year in review" feature request similar to the "Spotify wrapped" feature that I described [Link](https://forums.trakt.tv/t/trakt-for-books/43880)
- Users have complained about the book tracker app Fable using AI to create personal reader summaries that can be offensive; this would be avoided by just displaying charts with cross-media statistics as I described before [Link](https://bookriot.com/reading-apps-are-getting-controversial)
- Goodreads and Letterboxd have ratings associated with them which may skew others' perspectives of books/movies. With a minimal interfact just for tracking (no recommendation system), this platform would remain neutral and allow users to form their own uninfluenced opinions [Link](https://thebutlercollegian.com/2025/02/from-letterboxd-to-goodreads-is-social-media-ruining-media-consumption)

- **3 Features**

1. Display profile: A summary of what content the user has consumed, displaying statistics about what media the user tends to spend the most time on and genres that the user likes. Would also show the users favorites and include reviews and recommendations so that the user can easily share their interests with their friends.

2. "Wrapped" feature: similar to Spotify wrapped, where an annual summary of your music listening stats are revealed, but across all supported media types. Interesting statistics could be shown across all different types of media, giving the user an overall summary of how they spend their free time.

3. Minimal dashboard (without recommendations, rankings, and overwhelming statistics): this would allow the user to just search a name, add it/favorite it, and add notes to it, to avoid overwhelming the user.

## 💡 7 Unselected Domains

- **Finding restaurants/places to eat and places to visit**: Creating a truly highly reputable, master source of all recommended places is too big of an issue to solve, and would suffer from what all of the apps that have attempted this suffer from: lack of a user base or difficulty in gaining more users.
- **Keeping track of what groceries I need to get**: The solution is difficult since it is hard to incentivize the user to manually track and plan grocery trips and food consumption down to the detailed level necessary for shopping lists to be generated based on this data.
- **Watching movies/listening to music or podcasts together**: It would be difficult to allow many people to join a streaming session together without something like screensharing. Building a system that synchronizes playback across devices, handles restrictions from platforms like Youtube, Netflix, or Spotify, and manages latency would involve significant technical complexity. Since screensharing or existing “watch party” features (e.g., Teleparty) already solve this problem reasonably well, this project is less important than the other selected ones.screensharing can be a suitable substitute.
- **(Over)sleeping**: This would involve programmatically setting alarms on a mobile device, which is outside the practical scope of the project since it likely requires OS-level integration and permissions.
- **Shopping**: With social anxiety, it can be difficult to buy/sell things in a public environment, especially since people tend to get away with being rude/aggressive online rather than in person. Having something like Etsy but just for a localized community can make it easier for people to make anonymous bids on an item. It would make all sales be on one platform, insteaad of being barraged with sale emails at the beginning and end of every semester.
- **Doing multiplayer crossword puzzles**: I decided against this since crossword generation tailored to niche interests would require a large amount of domain-specific knowledge and natural language clue generation. While LLMs can generate puzzles, making them consistently fun, solvable, and properly calibrated in difficulty would require significant design and tuning effort.
